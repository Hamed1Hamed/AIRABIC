The AIRABIC dataset comprises two main categories:

1. `AI-generated texts.xlsx` - This dataset represents the collection of 500 examples of AI-generated Arabic texts.
2. `Human-written texts.xlsx` - This dataset represents the collection of 500 examples of Arabic texts written by humans.

## Ready-to-Use Text Files
We are pleased to announce that the dataset is also available in a ready-to-use text file format. Each category (`AI-generated texts` and `Human-written texts`) has been split into individual `.txt` files for ease of use. The `.txt` files are organized in the following folders:

- `output_AI-generated_txt`: Contains 500 AI-generated Arabic texts, each saved as an individual `.txt` file.
- `output_human-written_txt`: Contains 500 human-written Arabic texts, each saved as an individual `.txt` file.

This makes it incredibly straightforward to integrate our dataset into your existing natural language processing pipelines or research projects.

## Codebase

1. `Diacritics.py` - This script provides functionalities for building diacritics upon Arabic texts.
2. `NonDiacritics.py` - This script provides functionalities for removing diacritics from the Arabic texts.
3. `main.py` - main class.
